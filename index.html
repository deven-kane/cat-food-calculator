				Please enter your cats body weight in pounds. Feeding percentage will be
				1 - 3, 1 being under weight, 2 being healthy weight, 3 being over
				weight. Once calculated the feeding amount will be displayed in ounces.
				<br />
				This will be the daily feeding recommendation so split evenly between
				two meals. This calculation is based on commercial raw cat food. If
				making your own please refer to other references to be sure your food is
				complete and balanced in nutrition.
